            <p>Here&rsquo;s a general walkthrough for setting up a bootloader on the PinePhone.  We&rsquo;re going to use p-boot, which has nice start-times and lets you customize your boot screen with fancy graphics.  SD-card is not supplied with this tutorial, you need to provide your own.</p>
<p>These instructions are for Linux, but should be distribution-agnostic.  At the end, I will be using a Gentoo-specific tool, but it doesn&rsquo;t involve installing p-boot.</p>
<p>First, we need to grab some cross...

            <p>It seems a lot of people work directly or compile software directly on their Raspberry Pi.  I prefer to cross-compile on my desktop because it&rsquo;s way faster.  However, this also requires setting up a network share; transferring the SD card between the desktop and the RPI will get annoying very quickly.  While we&rsquo;re at it, we&rsquo;d might as well use an NFS root so we can make sure the init process only starts what we need.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve always had a love-hate relationship with Linux.  As a developer, its CLI tools are exactly what I need, it offers so many desktop environments that can be as minimal or bloated as you want, and installing a library you need is one command away, but Windows has all the mainstream applications.  For so many years, I&rsquo;ve dual-booted between Windows for games and Linux for work.  It was good enough for what I wanted, but as I get older, my tolerance for inconvenient workarounds ge...

            <p>This domain has been registered for quite a while, but I didn&rsquo;t bother to create a website, until now.  This is some thoughts on using Hugo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite familiar with the Javascript ecosystem (Node.JS, React, Sass/SCSS, Typescript, etc.), but wanted something simple without sacrificing too much flexibility.  I picked Hugo as the static site generator since it&rsquo;s a single executable that you have to download, not a Node.JS module with 6,725 dependencies to go along with i...
